# Challenge #1 Solution
looks like I got it right

# Adding in a max-width
A common problem - long lines are uncomfortable to read.
there's a simple fix: `max-width`

`max-width` applies after width.

`min-width` tends to cause problems in responsive design

# Challenge #2 changes:
* split the `.intro-content` into two layers of div: `.content` with a child of `half-width`
* wrapped the "more content" stuff into a `div.content`
* removed width related properties from the `container` class
* added the css properties on `.content` and `.half-width`
