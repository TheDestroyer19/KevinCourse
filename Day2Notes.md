# CSS em and rem explained

 * 1em generally defaults to 16px.
 * `em` on font-size are relative to the parent font size. Other properties are relative to the elment's font size
 * They compond on each other.
 * So if the parent has 2em, and the child 2em as well, it ends up being 4 times the size of the root font size.

 * `rem`s were made to resolve the componding problem with `em`s
 * `rem`s are consistant

 * `rem` and `em` work wherever you can put `px`
