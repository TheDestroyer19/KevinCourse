# CSS Units: vh, vw, vmin, vmax

This is one of Kevin's older videos.

## vh - viewport height
* this is relative to the window/viewport height.
* 100vh = height of the veiwport.
* 50vh = 50% of viewport height.
* stuff can spill out if the viewport height is small.
  Kevin doesn't say this but this sounds like it would be a good time to break out min-height

## vw -viewport width 
Same thing as `vh` but for width

## vmax, vmin
```
    vmax = max(vh, vw);
    vmin = min(vh, vw);
```

## cut video early - Kevin's production quality has increased a lot since this video was made
Its extra curricular anyway
